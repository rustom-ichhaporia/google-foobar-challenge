# google-foobar-challenge
 
These are my submissions to Google's "secret" foo-bar recruitment challenge. 

After searching for what Google considers to be many or certain specific "high level" coding terms, a pop-up was shown inviting me to take the challenge. 

This has been one of my most exciting coding challeges so far, despite being much shorter-term than my other projects. After reaching level 3, I was invited to enter my information for recruiters at Google.
